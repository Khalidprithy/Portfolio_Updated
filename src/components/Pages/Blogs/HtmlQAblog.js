                                    Responsive design is a method of designing websites so that they automatically adjust to the size of the user's screen.

                                    Adaptive design, on the other hand, uses specific layouts for specific screen sizes.

                                    Some ways to optimize the performance of a website include minifying code, compressing images, using a content delivery network (CDN), and reducing the number of HTTP requests.

                                    A development environment typically includes a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE), a web browser, and a local web server.

                                    One example of a project I have worked on is a MERN stack project where I have used React as a frontend framework and tailwind css for styling. I have also used react router v6 for routing and implemented authentication, layout, and an admin panel. I have also projected routes for the application. My role in the project was to develop the frontend and work closely with the backend developer to ensure smooth integration. Some of the challenges I faced included implementing complex authentication flows and optimizing the performance of the application. Through this project, I have learned how to work with a variety of frontend technologies and how to approach challenges in a systematic way

                                <p className='text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400'>
                                    An ordered list is a list of items in which the items are arranged in a specific order, usually using numbers or letters to indicate the order. An unordered list is a list of items in which the items are arranged in no particular order, usually using bullet points or other symbols to indicate that they are a list.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    In HTML, an ordered list is created using the 'ol' tag and each list item is enclosed in 'li' tags. The default numbering system is decimal.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    An unordered list is created using the 'ul' tag and each list item is enclosed in 'li' tags. The default bullet point is a disc.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    In summary, the main difference between ordered list and unordered list is that the former uses numbers or letters to indicate the order of the items, while the latter uses bullet points or other symbols to indicate that they are a list but without any particular order.

                                <p className='text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-2'>
                                    Semantic tags in HTML are tags that provide additional information about the meaning and structure of the content they enclose. These tags help search engines and other software to understand the content of a web page better. Some examples of semantic tags in HTML include:
                                </p>
                                <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>header</span> This tag represents the container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.</li>

                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>nav</span> This tag represents a section of a page that contains navigation links</li>

                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>article</span> This tag represents a self-contained composition in a document, such as a blog post, forum post, or news story.</li>

                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>section</span> This tag represents a thematic grouping of content, such as chapters, headings, or blocks of text.</li>

                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>footer </span> This tag represents the container for the footer of a document or a section.</li>

                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>figure </span>  This tag represents a unit of content, such as an image, video, table, or code snippet, that is referenced in the main content.</li>

                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>figcaption </span> This tag represents a caption for the figure</li>

                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>time </span> This tag represents a date and/or time</li>

                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>time </span> This tag represents a highlighted text.</li>

                                <p className='text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-2'>
                                    By using these semantic tags, developers can structure their HTML code in a way that makes it more meaningful and easier to understand for both humans and machines. This can lead to better accessibility, search engine optimization, and overall user experience.

It's also important to have high-quality content, good user experience and a well-structured website and link building strategy in place to have a well-rounded SEO approach.

                                    An iframe (short for "inline frame") is an HTML element that allows you to embed another HTML document within the current page. An iframe is a single window, it doesn't have multiple frames like frameset. It uses the 'iframe' tag and it's attributes like src, width, height, etc to define and display the content.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    On the other hand, a frameset is used to create a page that contains multiple frames or sections, each of which can display a different HTML document. A frameset uses the 'frameset' and 'frame' tags to define the structure and content of the frames.

                                    <br />
                                    In terms of accessibility and usability, iframes are considered to be a better option than framesets. Because iframes are self-contained and don't affect the layout and navigation of the parent page, they're less likely to cause accessibility problems. They also don't have the same issues with bookmarks, links, and keyboard navigation that framesets can have.
                                    <br />

                                    In terms of browser support, iframes are supported by all modern browsers and are widely used. On the other hand, framesets are less used these days because of the issues related to accessibility and usability.

                                    <br />
                                    In conclusion, iframes are generally considered to be a better option than framesets because they are more accessible and user-friendly, and they don't have the same issues with bookmarks, links, and keyboard navigation that framesets can have.

                                <p className='text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-2'>
                                    In HTML, some tags don't require an end tag because they don't contain any content. These are called void or self-closing tags. Here are a few examples of HTML tags that don't have an end tag:
                                </p>
                                <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>img</span>  This tag is used to embed images in a web page. It requires a "src" attribute, which specifies the URL of the image file.</li>

                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>input</span> This tag is used to create form controls, such as text fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons.</li>

                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>br</span> This tag is used to create a line break.</li>

                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>hr</span> This tag is used to create a horizontal rule.</li>

                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>meta </span> This tag is used to provide meta information about the web page, such as keywords and description.</li>

                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>link </span> This tag is used to link to an external resource, such as a CSS stylesheet</li>

                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>base </span> This tag is used to specify the base URL for all relative URLs in a web page.</li>

                                    <li><span className='font-medium'>source </span> This tag is used inside 'picture' or 'audio' or 'video' tag to specify the source of the media.</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p className='text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-2'>
                                    It's important to note that some of these tags are also able to have end tags like 'img' but it's not required, it's considered as a self-closing tag.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div className='shadow-sm rounded-lg p-2 mb-4 border hover:border-neutral'>
                                <h1 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold leading-tight text-gray-700 lg:mb-6 lg:text-xl dark:text-white">13. When are comments used in HTML?</h1>
                                <p className='text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-2'>
                                    Comments in HTML are used to provide notes or explanations about the code that are not displayed in the final webpage. They are a way to communicate with other developers or to document the code for future reference.
                                    Comments are typically used to:
                                </p>
                                <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
                                    <li>Explain the purpose of specific code or sections of code.</li>

                                    <li>Disable certain parts of code that are not currently in use.</li>

                                    <li>Provide information about the author, the date the code was written, and any other relevant details.</li>

                                    <li>Provide instructions or notes for other developers who may work on the code in the future.</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p className='text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-2'>
                                    It's important to note that comments are ignored by the browser, they don't affect how the web page is rendered and only used for developer's reference. It's also important to use comments in a way that makes the code easier to understand, and not to overuse them.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div className='shadow-sm rounded-lg p-2 mb-4 border hover:border-neutral'>
                                <h1 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold leading-tight text-gray-700 lg:mb-6 lg:text-xl dark:text-white">14. What is the purpose of using alternative texts in images?</h1>
                                <p className='text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-2'>
                                    The purpose of using alternative text (alt text) in images is to provide a text description of the image for users who are unable to see the image. Alt text is used to make images accessible to people with visual impairments who use screen readers to access web content. It also provides a text alternative for the image when the image fails to load or in case the user has chosen to disable images in their browser.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    It's also important to note that the alt text should be meaningful and relevant, it should provide context and information about the image. It should not be redundant or unnecessary, for example, if the image is used as a decorative element, the alt text should be left empty or set to alt="" to indicate that it's not providing any relevant information
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    In summary, the purpose of using alternative texts in images is to make the web more accessible for users with visual impairments and to provide a text alternative for the image if the image fails to load. It also helps search engines to understand the images in the web page.
